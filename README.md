# interview-todo

## Assignment
Our new TODO tracker app is launching tomorrow, and we're finally going to be rich! We do still have a few minor things we need to address though before launch. Could you please:
1. Give a quick pass through it to make sure the current functionality is ready to ship.
1. Add the ability to re-order items in the todo list.
1. Add some simple search functionality, to help power users find their todos.

## Dev Setup
1. Create a python venv.
1. Activate the venv.
1. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
1. `python -m app.server`

## Notes
- Treat the code you write, within reason, as though it was production code that you were going to be responsible for in the future.
- This app is powered by SQLite. This obviously wouldn't cut it for a real app, but for the purposes of this assignment we don't expect you to use anything else.
- Please feel free to ask questions if any of the requirements are vague.
